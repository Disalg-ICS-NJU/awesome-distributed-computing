## Title: Understanding Consistency Models for RDT in Distributed Systems

## Background
Consistency 在多个context下出现:
- multiprocessor shared-memory system => memory model
- distributed system => consistency model

## Motivation
Hard to understand.

Understanding 的手段:
- prove "correspondence"
	- manual proof
	- model checking?
	- theorem proving
- synthesis

## Outline

## Work

## Challenges

Synthesis of CM for RDT 的难点:
- RDT 包含丰富的数据类型 (先考虑 read/write registers)
